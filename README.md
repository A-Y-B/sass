My SASS template (by akella), or boilerplate, whatever =)
=============

I'm using this as a starting template for almost any project now.
It includes sprites, assorted mixins (aka code snippets), file structure, jquery+cycle+scrollto (most usable these days).
And, that's it.

You need to have Compass installed for it to work properly.

Structure
=============
_/sass/libs_ - all the mixins and libs needed for us.

_/sass/_base.scss_ - agregates all those libraries and some common styles

_/sass/screen.scss_ - agregates all .scss files.
