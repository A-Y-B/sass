My SASS template (by akella)
=============

I'm using this as a starting template for almost any project now.
It includes sprites, assorted mixins (aka code snippets), file structure, jquery+jquery scrollable+cycle+scrollto (most usable these days). 
And, that's it.

You need to have Compass installed for it to work properly.
