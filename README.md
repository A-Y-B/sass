My SASS template (by akella), or boilerplate, whatever =)
=============

I'm using this as a starting template for almost any project now.
It includes sprites, assorted mixins (aka code snippets), file structure, jquery+jquery scrollable+cycle+scrollto (most usable these days). 
And, that's it.

You need to have Compass installed for it to work properly.

Structure
=============
/sass/libs - all the mixins and libs needed for us.

/sass/_base.scss - agregates all those libraries and some common styles

/sass/screen.scss - main file
